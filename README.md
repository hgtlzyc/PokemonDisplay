Goal:

Using Combine to restore, resume, track the downloading progress of large amount of pokemon infos(including pictures) from the pokemon open API

Create cache system able to restore the app after user kills the app

Able to open by URLs and set the app to corresponding status


Currently achieved:

Kill the app and then reopen will be able to restore the downloaded values and progress 06/11/21

Able to track, cancel, redo the download tasks 06/10/21

Property wrapper Cache system store the viewmodels as json files 06/09/21

Next:

make the task able to "resume" after cancel the task( manually or app killed)

Background:
Read many books and want to practice/demonstrate my skills, 

currently I did not find codes showing how to resume/track/restore downloadings using Combine,

so I decided to make my own project/ 

currently looking for entry level iOS developer jobs
